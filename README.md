CollabBoard :Collaborate seamlessly, sketch effortlessly.
CollabBoard is a high-performance, real-time collaborative whiteboard designed to bridge the gap between remote communication and visual brainstorming.
Built for teams, educators, and creatives, it provides a frictionless digital canvas where multiple users can ideate, sketch, and iterate together in an instant.

By leveraging WebSockets for low-latency synchronization, CollabBoard ensures that every stroke, text addition,
and erase action is reflected across all connected screens simultaneously. No more static screen sharing or "one-person-controls-the-mouse"
bottlenecks—CollabBoard creates a democratic workspace where ideas flow as fast as you can draw them.

Physical whiteboards are great, but they don't scale for remote work. CollabBoard solves this by providing a persistent, 
digital version of the "war room" experience. Whether you are wireframing a new app, teaching a complex math concept,
or mapping out a sprint plan, CollabBoard makes your remote collaboration feel like you're standing at the same board.
